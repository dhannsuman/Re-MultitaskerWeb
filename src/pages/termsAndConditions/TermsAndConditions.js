The Multitasker terms &amp; conditions outline Multitasker and Your obligations and responsibilities on the Multitasker Platform.&nbsp;User Agreement: <a href="https://www.multitaskerbda.com/">www.multitaskerbda.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Multitasker operates an online platform allowing Users to connect through the&nbsp; Multitasker Platform with other Users who provide Services.</p><p>Please read these terms and our privacy policy carefully before using the Multitasker Platform. These Policies are incorporated into this Agreement by reference.</p><ol><li>SCOPE OF Multitasker SERVICES Basic Principles</li></ol><p>1.1 Multitasker provides the Multitasker Platform to enable Posters to publish Posted Tasks.</p><p>1.2 Taskers may make an Offer in response to a Posted Task. Some parts of Offer details may be made publicly available, including to internet users who are not Users.</p><p>1.3 A Poster may revoke or modify a Posted Task at any time before he/she accepts an Offer. Multitasker reserves the right to cancel all Offers&nbsp; on a Posted Task made prior to the modiﬁcation.</p><p>1.4 If a Poster accepts an Offer on the Multitasker Platform, a Task Contract is created between the Tasker and the Poster.</p><p>1.5 Upon creation of a Task Contract, the Poster must pay the Agreed Price into the Payment Account.</p><p>1.6 Upon creation of the Task Contract, Multitasker has rendered Multi- tasker Services and the Service Fee is due and payable.</p><p>1.7 Once the Task Contract is created, the Tasker and Poster may vary the Task Contract on the Multitasker Platform. The Poster and Tasker are encouraged to use multitaskers private messaging system to amend or vary the Task Contract (including the Agreed Price) or to otherwise communicate.</p><p>1.8 Once the Services are complete, the Tasker must provide notice of that on the Multitasker Platform.</p><p>1.9 Once the Services are complete, the Poster must provide notice of that on the Multitasker Platform.</p><p>1.10 Once the Posted Task has been completed and the Poster conﬁrms the Services are completed, or if Multitasker is satisﬁed the Services have been completed, the Tasker Funds will be released. Taskers are paid once a week. However this process does not apply to the payment of Recurring Services which is addressed in clause 1.13 below.</p><p>1.11 After the Task Contract is completed, the parties are encouraged to review and provide feedback of the Services on the Multitasker Platform Recurring Service</p><p>1.12 For Recurring Services and subject to clause 1.21, once the Occurrence has been completed and the Tasker conﬁrms the Occurrence is completed (or if Multitasker is satisﬁed the Occurrence is completed)&nbsp; then the Tasker Funds for that Occurrence will automatically be released by Multitasker from the Payment Account to the Tasker.</p><p>1.13 The Poster may elect to pause automatic payment of Tasker Funds for an Occurrence within 24 hours from when the Tasker conﬁrms the Occurrence is completed. If the Poster pauses such automatic&nbsp; payment in accordance with this clause, then the Tasker Funds will not be released by Multitasker from the Payment Account to the Tasker until&nbsp; the Poster also conﬁrms that the Occurrence is completed.</p><ol start="2"><li>Multitaskers ROLE AND OBLIGATIONS</li></ol><p>2.1 Multitasker provides the Multitasker Platform only, enabling Users to publish and make Offers on Posted Tasks or publish Offers for Services&nbsp; or make Instant Claims of Tasker Listings.</p><p>2.2 Multitasker only permits individuals over 18 years of age to become Users.</p><p>2.3 Users must be natural persons</p><p>2.4 At its absolute discretion, Multitasker may refuse to allow any person to register or create an account with Multitasker or cancel or suspend or modify any existing account including if Multitasker reasonably&nbsp; forms the view that a User’s conduct (including a breach of this Agreement) is detrimental to the operation of the Multitasker Platform.</p><p>2.5 Registering and creating an account with Multitasker is free.

When using&nbsp; Search Assist, the Task Contract is created when the Tasker makes an Instant Claim.</p><p>1.2 The Task Contract will continue until terminated in accordance&nbsp; with clause 7.</p><p>2 SERVICES</p><p>2.1 The Tasker will perform Services in a proper and workmanlike&nbsp;manner.</p><p>2.2 The Tasker must perform the Services at the time and location&nbsp;agreed.</p><p>2.3 The parties must perform their obligations in accordance with&nbsp;any other terms or conditions agreed by the parties during or sub- sequent to the creation of the Task Contract.</p><p>2.4 The parties acknowledge that the Task Contract is one of personal service where the Poster selected the Tasker to perform the&nbsp; Services. Therefore the Tasker must not subcontract any part of&nbsp;the Services to any third party without the Poster’s consent.</p><p>2.5 The Tasker remains responsible and liable at all times to the&nbsp;Poster for any acts or omissions of a subcontractor as if those acts or omissions had been made by the Tasker.</p><ul><li>WARRANTIES</li></ul><p>3.1 Each party warrants that the information provided in the creation of the Task Contract is true and accurate.</p><p>3.2 The Tasker warrants that they have (and any subcontractor&nbsp;has) the right to work and provide Services and hold all relevant licences.</p><ul><li>PAYMENT OR CANCELLATION</li></ul><p>4.1 Upon the creation of the Task Contract, the Poster must pay&nbsp;</p><p>the Agreed Price into the Payment Account.</p><p>4.2 Upon the Services being completed, the Tasker will provide&nbsp;</p><p>notice on the Multitasker Platform.</p><p>4.3 The Poster will be prompted to conﬁrm the Services are complete.
